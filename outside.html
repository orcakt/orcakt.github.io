        <p>I spend most of my free time drawing. I enjoy challenging myself, drawing different poses that aren't normal. I also enjoy writing books. I'm currently working on a series of short, fictional, books that talk about some of the misunderstood points of mental health. I like to kayak with my dad, though we don't get to very often. We make our kayaks. I also enjoy making little plushies. I have three so far and I'm working on a pattern for the fourth. Overall, I just love creating things.</p>

        <p>My grandma, René Kerste, has done a program called BASIC, or <em>Benevolent Acts of Service in Children</em>, for three years now. I help her a lot with these activities. It includes making mats out of plastic bags for the homeless, medical dolls for children's hospitals, and what my grandma called "Cuddle Babies," which are used in the NICU. Outside of my grandma's events, I try to take any opportunity I can to serve.</p>

        <p>The farthest I've traveled was Alaska, but we normally stay in Utah or neighboring
            states. My family goes camping a lot. We haven't been able to as much recently because of gas prices and (in my case) a need for weekends to be used for homework. We've been to many State and National Parks, including Yellowstone, Arches, and the Grand Canyon.</p>
